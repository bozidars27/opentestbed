The gorgeous box that you see, is part of a set of 20 otboxes which are distributed in our building in Paris. This set of boxes is a test bed that we use to see how our lastest  '''''' works in a real environment.

Because we need them to continue developing the tomorrow's Internet of important Things, we would ask you to please do not unplug our otboxes and about the electromagnetic radiation don't worry, its effects are only myths.
