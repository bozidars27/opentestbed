# Hi there!

You are looking at one element of the [OpenTestbed](http://testbed.openwsn.org), which we use to test the low-power wireless protocols we develop for those IoT devices. This testbed is developped as part of the [OpenWSN](http://www.openwsn.org) project by the [Inria EVA](https://team.inria.fr/eva/) team.

Inside, there are 4 [OpenMote B](http://openmote.com/) low-power wireless sensors (top half) and one raspberry Pi computer (bottom half). The raspberry Pi is connected to our cloud infrastructure over WiFi, allowing us to program and interact with the sensors.

Feel free to send questions to thomas.watteyne@inria.fr.
