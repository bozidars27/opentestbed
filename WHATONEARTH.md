# Hi there!

You are looking at one element of the [OpenTestbed](http://testbed.openwsn.org), which is used to test the low-power wireless protocols we develop for those IoT devices to communicate together. This tetsbed is developped as part of the [OpenWSN](http://www.openwsn.org) project by the [Inria EVA](https://team.inria.fr/eva/) team.

What you see are 4 [OpenMote B](http://openmote.com/) low-power wireless sensors (at the top) and one raspberry Pi computer (at the bottom). The raspberry Pi is connected to our cloud infrastructure over WiFi, allowing us to program and interact with the sensors.

Feel free to send questions to thomas.watteyne@inria.fr.
